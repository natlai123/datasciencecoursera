# Exploratory Data Analysis Course Assignment 1

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” will be used to generate four exploratory graphics, namely `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png`, and `plot4.png`. Each graph is accompanied with its R script for reproduction's use. The four R scripts are `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, and `plot4.R`.



**Dataset**: Electric power consumption

**Description**: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

* `Date`: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

* `Time`: time in format hh:mm:ss

* `Global_active_power`: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

* `Global_reactive_power`: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

* `Voltage`: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

* `Global_intensity`: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

* `Sub_metering_1`: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

* `Sub_metering_2`: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

* `Sub_metering_3`: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
