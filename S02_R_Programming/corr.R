# corr() takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases
# and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor 
# locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) 
# is greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector of 
# correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
# If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should 
# return a numeric vector of length 0


corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0){
    # Since the function checks all files in the specdata, dynamic importing 
    # (in part 1 and 2) is not needed here. To take all files into account, use
        files_input <- dir(directory, full.names = TRUE)
        dlist <- lapply(files_input, data.table::fread)
        data <- data.table::rbindlist(dlist)
    # remove NA items
        data <- data[complete.cases(data)]
    # Using data.table's feature (by=ID) to obtain obs num. and correlation within 
    # each sublist (eg 001.csv)  then chaining (imposing constraint) [N > threshold] 
    # to select only sublists that meet the threshold.  
        data <- data[, .(nobs= .N, Correlation=cor(sulfate, nitrate)), by = ID][nobs > threshold]
    return(data[, Correlation])
