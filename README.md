Data Science Specialization
========================================================

This is the master respository containing my work for the [Coursera Data Science][1] Specialization. Each of the subdirectories correpsond to a different course and are self-contained. The official repository for the specialization can be found [here][2].

## Data Scientist's Toolbox
The first course of the specialization orients student to the field of data science. A note on proper data sharing can be found [here][3]. The objectives for the [Data Scientist's Toolbox][4] were to set expectations for the Coursera Specialization and to gain familiarity with GitHub and Rmarkdown. 

## R Programming
The course in [R Programming][5] involved familiarizing you with [R][6] and [RStudio][7]. This course involved two minor programming assignments to demonstrate R programming. My primary files for the course can be round [here][8]. The second programming assignment is part of a fork and can be found [here][9].

## Getting and Cleaning Data
The course in [Getting and Cleaning Data][10] involves learning methods to generate "tidy" datasets. My primary files for the course can be round [here][11].

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The course in [Exploratory Data Analysis][12] covers the basic R plot function, the lattice package, ggplot, hierarchical Clustering, k-means Clustering, principle compoment analysis. My primary files for the course can be round [here][13]. In addional to the two projects required for passing the course, I have also create a note on principle compoment analysis which is included in the [subdirectory][14].

## Reproducible Research
The course in [Reproducible Research][15]  and introduces the use of [Rpubs][16]. My Rpubs report for this class can be found [here][17].

# A Brief Reflection on Learning R
#### 9, March, 2018
---------

Over the past two months, I have been focusing on learning the statistical software programming language, R. I was told that the learning curve for R is steep. And it is. But the journey is surprisingly fun and eye-opening. Leaning R is more than learning its syntax. It, more importantly, involves the thinking and approach to conduct data analysis, particularly if one dives into “Tidyverse”. It is about time for me to sit down and reflect on how far I have got and where I am heading.

Even though I am not a newbie when it comes to statistical programming languages (I learnt Stata, SAS, Matlab before beginning this full-blown effort in conquering R), R, in my opinion, is vast.

I primarily rely on the following online resources:

* DataCamp
* Coursera: Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Data Science Specialization

The combination of DataCamp and Coursera’s JHU Specialization is extremely useful. The former teaches not only a lot of product knowledge and of R, but also comes with a wealth of practices for one to get a feel for the language. The latter provides assignments that require quite some “hacking skills” (effort to self-learn and solve problems). It is no easy task to map what I have learnt to JHU’s assignments. But that is where I deepen my understanding of the R language. Thinking of various ways to accomplish a given task. 

I suggested beginners start by reading and playing around the code in Garrett Grolemund (2014). See some reviews on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22779823-hands-on-programming-with-r). The book starts off slowly and builds your confidence. The real fun is in the last section of the book “slot machine” where you will learn lexical scoping through a simulation example in R. I really appreciate the author’s effort in challenging the reader to improve on their code, which is important and engaging. The swirl package in R is also a great source to turn to in conjunction with JHU Specialization (like a review session). 

Everything is still work in progress and there is no end to learning. Taking MOOC courses is a great way to learn. But the effort lies in practices, note-taking and code-writing. Currently, the content page of all my notes is like:

1. R Programming (0) Data Structure
2. R Programming (1) Object-Oriented: S3
3. R Programming (2) Functional purrr
4. R Programming (3) Object-Oriented: R6
5. R Importing Data (1) csv, xlsx 
6. R Importing Data (2) Other statistical software packages
7. R Importing Data (3) Database 
8. R Importing Data (4) Web 
9. R Importing Data (5) JSON
10. R Importing Data (5) XML 
11. R Importing Data (6) Financial Data
12. R Time Series (1) lubridate
13. R Time Series (2) xts & zoo 
14. R Time Series (3) ARIMA
15. R Data Manipulation (1) tidyr 
16. R Data Manipulation (2) String
17. R Data Manipulation (3) Rebus & Regular Expression
18. R Data Manipulation (4) dplyr
19. R Data Manipulation (5) data.Table
20. R Markdown and Studio Shortcuts
21. R Visualization (1) Base 
22. R Visualization (2) Graphics Device and Colour
23. R Visualization (3) Lattice Plotting System
24. R Visualization (4) Time Series Data
25. R Visualization (5) ggplot2 (1) 
26. R VisualizatioN (6) ggplot2 (2)
27. R Visualization (7) ggplot2 (3)
28. R Visualization (8) ggplot2 (4)
29. R Statistic (1) Exploratory Data Analysis 
30. R Statistic (2) Inference, Correlation and Regression
31. R Statistic (3) Hierarchical Clustering, K-means Clustering, PCA 
32. R Finance (1) Financial Trading
33. R Finance (2) qrmdata

Along the way, learning database concepts and languages such as JSON, XML, and SQL (Introduction to Databases by Stanford Lagunita is a good source), text mining using regular expression and version control (Git) will compliment learning R well.

In the coming months, I will continue to digest the following material:

* Garrett Grolemund (2014) Hands-On Programming with R
* Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund (2016) R for Data Science http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.htm
* Hadley Wickham (2010) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis 
* Hadley Wickham (2018) Advanced R https://adv-r.hadley.nz/introduction.html
* Roger D. Peng, Elizabeth Matsui (2015) The Art of Data Science: A Guide for Anyone Who Works with Data
* Norman Matloff (2011) The Art of R Programming
* Gareth James et al. (2013), An Introduction to Statistical Learning
* Hastie et al. (2009) The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd Edition Springer
* Ruey S. Tsay (2010) Analysis of Financial Time Series, Third Edition, Wiley
* Rob J Hyndman, George Athanasopoulos, (2017) Forecasting: Principles and Practice

For some of the books, I have already had produced a few notes. If time allows, I will put out them out on Github as well.

This project in learning is an important steps towards my mastery in data analytics. It lies in nicely with other tools such as Python, Matlab, SAS, Excel VBA, and Tableau. The ultimate goal is to be able to answer questions with the method of data analytics, which, I believe, is always a way that generates interesting perspective for our better understanding of the world we live in.
