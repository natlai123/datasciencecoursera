# A Brief Reflection on Learning R

Over the past two months, I have been focusing on learning the statistical software programming language, R. I was told that the learning curve for R is steep. And it is. But the journey is surprisingly fun and eye-opening. Leaning R is more than learning its syntax. It, more importantly, involves the thinking and approach to conduct data analysis, particularly if one dives into “Tidyverse”. It is about time for me to sit down and reflect on how far I have got and where I am heading.

Even though I am not a newbie when it comes to statistical programming languages (I learnt Stata, SAS, Matlab before beginning this full-blown effort in conquering R), R, in my opinion, is vast. 

I primarily rely on the following online resources:

* DataCamp
* Coursera: Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Data Science Specialization

The combination of DataCamp and Coursera’s JHU Specialization is extremely useful. The former teaches not only a lot of product knowledge and of R, but also comes with a wealth of practices for one to get a feel for the language. The latter provides assignments that require quite some “hacking skills” (effort to self-learn and solve problems). It is no easy task to map what I have learnt to JHU’s assignments. But that is where I deepen my understanding of the R language. Thinking of various ways to accomplish a given task. 

I suggested beginners start by reading and playing around the code in Garrett Grolemund (2014). See some reviews on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22779823-hands-on-programming-with-r). The book starts off slowly and builds your confidence. The real fun is in the last section of the book “slot machine” where you will learn lexical scoping through a simulation example in R. I really appreciate the author’s effort in challenging the reader to improve on their code, which is important and engaging. The swirl package in R is also a great source to turn to in conjunction with JHU Specialization (like a review session). 

Everything is still work in progress and there is no end to learning. Taking MOOC courses is a great way to learn. But the effort lies in practices, note-taking and code-writing. Currently, the content page of all my notes is like:

1. R Data Structure
2. R Object-Oriented Programming: S3
3. R Functional Programming purrr
4. R Object-Oriented Programming: R6
5. R & csv, xlsx
6. R & Other statistical software packages
7. R & Database
8. R & Web
9. R & JSON
10. R & XML
11. R & Importing and Managing Financial Data
12. R tidyr
13. R lubridate
14. R xts & zoo
15. R & Time Series Data (1)
16. R String
17. R Rebus & Regular Expression
18. R dplyr
19. R Data.Table
20. R Markdown and Studio Shortcuts
21. R Base Visualization
22. R Graphics Device, Lattice Plotting System and Colour
23. R & Time Series Data Visualization
24. R ggplot2 (1)
25. R ggplot2 (2)
26. R ggplot2 (3)
27. R ggplot2 (4)
28. R & EDA
29. R Inference, Correlation and Regression
30. R Financial Trading


Along the way, learning database concepts and languages such as JSON, XML, and SQL (Introduction to Databases by Stanford Lagunita is a good source), text mining using regular expression and version control (Git) will compliment learning R well.

In the coming months, I will continue to digest the following material:

* Garrett Grolemund (2014) Hands-On Programming with R
* Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund (2016) R for Data Science http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.htm
*
* Hadley Wickham (2010) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis 
* Hadley Wickham (2018) Advanced R https://adv-r.hadley.nz/introduction.html
* Roger D. Peng, Elizabeth Matsui (2015) The Art of Data Science: A Guide for Anyone Who Works with Data
* Norman Matloff (2011) The Art of R Programming
* Gareth James et al. (2013), An Introduction to Statistical Learning
* Hastie et al. (2009) The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd Edition Springer
* Ruey S. Tsay (2010) Analysis of Financial Time Series, Third Edition, Wiley

For some of the books, I have already had produced a few notes. If time allows, I will put out them out on Github as well.

This project in learning is an important steps towards my mastery in data analytics. It lies in nicely with other tools such as Python, Matlab, SAS, Excel VBA, and Tableau. The ultimate goal is to be able to answer questions with the method of data analytics, which, I believe, is always a way that generates interesting perspective for our better understanding of the world we live in.
